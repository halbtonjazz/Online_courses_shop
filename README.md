A functional web application with frontend navigation, an admin panel, and an API service for server communication. The "Online Courses Shop" web project, powered by Django, displays courses from an SQLite database on the main page. It provides user-friendly navigation to individual course pages and includes:
- Managing courses and categories, including adding, editing, and deletion.
- User management in the admin panel, enabling user addition and removal, as well as authentication and authorization features.

Additionally, the project incorporates a custom API for streamlined database resource access, allowing you to:
- Access all courses and categories.
- Retrieve specific courses or categories.
- Add new courses or categories.
- Remove courses or categories as needed.
